        <p className="text-2xl leading-relaxed mb-6">
          I’m a dedicated DevOps, Cloud, and Data Engineer with a strong foundation in software engineering. I specialize in building secure, scalable, and automated infrastructure that streamlines software delivery and data operations.
        </p>

        <p className="text-2xl leading-relaxed mb-6">
          With hands-on experience in CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes orchestration, and infrastructure as code using tools like Terraform and Ansible, I’ve delivered robust solutions on AWS. My software development background allows me to bridge the gap between code, infrastructure, and data workflows—promoting seamless team collaboration.
        </p>

        <p className="text-2xl leading-relaxed mb-6">
          I also design scalable and cost-efficient data pipelines and analytics platforms. Whether orchestrating ETL workflows, integrating AWS-native services, or optimizing data access and storage, I bring a data-centric approach to platform engineering.
        </p>

        <p className="text-2xl leading-relaxed mb-6">
          As a strong advocate of DevSecOps and data governance, I implement best practices in access control, encryption, and vulnerability management. I thrive in collaborative environments and am committed to continuous learning in the evolving cloud and DevOps landscape.
